                    <h2 id='reflection-header'>Job Description</h2>
                    <p>As a Data Management Assistant I worked for Data Solutions under the Data Management Team. These were my main responsibilities:</p>
                    <p>I performed QA and software testing across 5 application to ensure 99% accuracy. I used SQL, Jira, Excel, and IBM Notes as QA tools. I learned about the software development life cycle and how an application goes from development to testing/staging to production.</p>
                    <p>I oversaw the process of setting up employee profiles and territory updates. I managed Jira tickets coordinating responsibilities between Developers and other Data Solutions team members. I performed the overall QA of the tickets.</p>
                    <p>I helped create a database dictionary for employee training. I wrote SQL queries to access data points specific applications. The database dictionary will be a helpful tool for future Kenna employees and I am glad that I got to make an impact to help the company.</p>
                    <p>I created a tool update proposal to make the companies main application more user friendly. <br/><br/> Lastly, I preformed a code review on a code base to reduce code redundancy and increase efficiency in updates to the code base.</p>

                    <h3 id='goal-header'>1. Improve my written communication skills so that I can converse effectively in a professional manner.</h3>
                    <p>My written communication skills drastically improved and so has my confidence in my ability to communicate proffesionally. I notice this confidence that I have learned continuing in my life outside of work.</p>
                    <h3 id='goal-header'>2. Improve my Excel skills.</h3>
                    <p>Excel was a tool I had to use daily for QA and because of that my Excel skills improved. The strengthening of these skills allowed me to complete work more efficiently and in a timelier manner. I clearly saw my skills improve in my ability to do data matches over large datasets. Now I can perform QA over large data sets with ease. </p>
                    <h3 id='goal-header'>3. Improve my quantitative literacy to improve my QA skills</h3>
                    <p>Each day I did a sweep of certain tools to determine if there were any bugs. This included comparing data points. I was able to spot bugs so fixes could be implemented to the software. My ability to spot these bugs assured me that I did indeed improve when it comes to quantitative literacy.</p>

                    <p>As an Application Developer I created full stack web applications using ReactJS, NodeJS, SQL, HTML/CSS and Lotus Script. 
                        We operated in an agile development environment where I used Jira to track tickets, BitBucket for version control, and Jenkins for deployment.

                    <h3 id='goal-header'>1. Improve my programming speed</h3>
                    <p>I used to be an overly cautious programmer and would second guess my work. This work term increased my confidence resulting in an increase in my programming speed. I was able to meet deadlines and complete work in a timely manner. My supervisor praised me for my ability to meet deadlines.</p>
                    <h3 id='goal-header'>2. Solve problems independently using critical thinking</h3>
                    <p>My problem solving skills have increased a lot since beginning this role. The more time I spent working the more comfortable I felt solving problems on my own. I was able to work independently on a lot of tasks and take on large independent development roles.</p>
                    <h3 id='goal-header'>3. Learn as much as possible</h3>
                    <p>I learned so much during my time in this position. Having my first Developer role allowed me to learn a lot about modern and legacy programming technologies. I am more familiar with the software development life cycle. I am much more confident working with SQL and Javascript than I was before. This was also my first work term that wasn't remote so I learned how conduct myself in an in person office environment.</p>

                <p>I would like to thank my supervisors for all the support throughout my time at Kenna. I would like to thank Kenna for fostering such a positive work environment which wouldnâ€™t be the same without all the amazing people that work there. One of the best things about working at Kenna was the company culture and I would like to thank all the people that planned social events that made work so fun.</p>
                <p>Working at Kenna was an amazing experience and I have learned so much in my three work terms there. </p>
