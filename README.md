# PersonalWebsiteV2
Personal Website developed with ReactJS. </br></br>
Website includes my Co-op report for the Summer and Fall 2023 work terms in the Experience section. </br></br>
UI inspired by https://zainkho.com/about which I found on https://medium.com/@meyrehay/8-student-websites-to-influence-your-own-1088cd61f7c1 </br></br>
