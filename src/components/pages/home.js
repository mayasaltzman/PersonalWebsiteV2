        <p>I am currently a third year <span id='cs'>Computer Science Honors Co-op</span> student at the <span id='uni'>University of Guelph.</span> I most recently spent an eight month co-op work term at <span id='kenna'>Kenna</span> in the Data Management Department. I am passionate about environmentally sustainable tech. I enjoy learning about combining tech and ethics! <br /><br />
          I am the <span id='pres'>President</span> of the <span id='GCC'>Guelph Coding Community </span>and love my computing community.
          <br /><br />I like to spend my free time in nature or reading. You can find me camping and going on hikes. Over the years I have spent a total of 90 days in the woods.
          I collect vinyls and recently have been enjoying trying out new vegan recipes. <br /><br />Iâ€™m inspired by people who want to make the tech industry more inclusive!
