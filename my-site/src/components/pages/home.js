      <p>I am currently a third year Computer Science Honors Co-op student at the University of Guelph. I most recently spent an eight month co-op work term at Kenna in the Data Management Department. I am passionate about environmentally sustainable tech. I enjoy learning about ways developers can combine tech and ethics!</p>
      <p>I am the President of the Guelph Coding Community at the University of Guelph and love my campus computing community.</p>
      <p>I like to spend my free time in nature or reading a book. I love camping and going on hikes.  I have experience leading canoe trips and have spent 90 days in the woods.
        I have recently been enjoying trying out new vegan recipes.
      </p>
      <p>Iâ€™m inspired by people who want to make the tech industry more inclusive creatives. If that sounds like you, let's grab some coffee!</p>
